# Gruvbox Girl Revisited - [1920x1080]
  
### Lore:

I was looking for this wallpaper for a while, but I only saw rice's linux with it, but apparently it had disappeared<br>
I used a tool (possibly the same one that was used to modify the original image and leave it gruvbox) to try to revive the image.

### Used Tool

The tool used was [gowall](https://github.com/Achno/gowall), using it to convert the original image to the gruvbox scheme.<br>
The old image that was on the internet was practically identical to this one, the basic examples are below:
